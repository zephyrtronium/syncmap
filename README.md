# syncmap

This repository contains the code for my articles, [Sync Map, Reconstructed](https://zephyrtronium.github.io/articles/syncmap) and its eventual sequel. It is heavily inspired by the implementation of `sync.Map` [in the Go standard library](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/release-branch.go1.16/src/sync/map.go).

The "final product" for the first article is [v0.1.0](https://github.com/zephyrtronium/syncmap/tree/v0.1.0).

Feel free to use this code, although it is worse.
